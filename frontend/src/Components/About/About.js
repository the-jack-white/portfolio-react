                                My name is Jack White (and before you ask, I'm not related to the lead singer of The White Stripes).<br/><br/>I started my career as a GIS Technician, but soon changed my direction to Full Stack Development, more specifically, Front End Development.
                                <br/><br/>I can go on a whole tangent on why I made the decision, but in short, I found my passion. 
                                As I got to work on my new passion, I realised how little time in a day there is to learn, and three years later, I realised that one will never stop learning, hence why I call it my passion.
                                <br/><br/>I love to collaborate and share new ideas with like-minded people, so if youâ€™re the same, feel free to drop me a message on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/the-jack-white/">LinkedIn</a>.

                            Eye-poppingly prolific, full stack developer with a passion for metrics and information.
